Controller Layer (Business Logic)
      ↓
Service Layer (External APIs)
      ↓
Model Layer (Database Operations)
      ↓
Database (MongoDB)
```

**Key Design Patterns**:
- **MVC Pattern**: Separation of concerns
- **Middleware Pattern**: Request processing pipeline
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction
- **Service Pattern**: Business logic encapsulation

### Security Architecture

**Authentication Flow**:
```
1. User Login → Credentials Validation
2. Password Hashing Check (bcrypt)
3. JWT Token Generation
4. Token Sent to Client
5. Client Stores Token (localStorage)
6. Subsequent Requests Include Token
7. Server Validates Token (Middleware)
8. Request Processed if Valid
```

**Security Measures**:
- Password hashing with bcrypt (10 rounds)
- JWT token expiration (7 days)
- CORS configuration
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention (Mongoose)
- XSS protection
- Rate limiting (recommended for production)

## 💻 Development

### Code Style

**TypeScript**:
- Strict mode enabled
- Explicit type annotations
- Interface over type for objects
- Avoid `any` type

**React**:
- Functional components with hooks
- Custom hooks for reusable logic
- Props destructuring
- Meaningful component names

**Naming Conventions**:
- Components: PascalCase (`UserProfile.tsx`)
- Files: camelCase (`authService.ts`)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`API_BASE_URL`)
- Functions: camelCase (`getUserProfile`)

### Project Scripts

**Frontend** (`codeandchill/`):
```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run preview      # Preview production build
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
```

**Backend** (`Backend/server/`):
```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm start            # Start production server
npm run seed         # Seed database
```

### Adding New Features

#### Adding a New Page
1. Create component in `src/pages/`
2. Add route in `App.tsx`
3. Create necessary services in `src/services/`
4. Add types in `src/types/`

#### Adding a New API Endpoint
1. Create route in `Backend/server/src/routes/`
2. Add model if needed in `src/models/`
3. Implement business logic
4. Add authentication middleware if required
5. Update API documentation

### Testing

**Recommended Testing Stack**:
- **Unit Tests**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **Integration Tests**: Supertest for API
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright or Cypress

**Test Commands** (to be implemented):
```bash
npm test              # Run all tests
npm run test:watch    # Watch mode
npm run test:coverage # Coverage report
```

## 🚢 Deployment

### Frontend Deployment (Vercel/Netlify)

#### Vercel
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
cd codeandchill
vercel
```

**Environment Variables** (Vercel Dashboard):
- `VITE_API_URL`: Your backend URL

- `VITE_RAPID_API_HOST`: judge0-ce.p.rapidapi.com

#### Netlify
```bash
# Build
npm run build

# Deploy dist folder via Netlify CLI or Dashboard
```

**Build Settings**:
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Publish directory: `dist`

### Backend Deployment

#### Railway
1. Connect GitHub repository
2. Select `Backend/server` as root directory
3. Add environment variables
4. Deploy automatically on push

#### Render
1. Create new Web Service
2. Connect repository
3. Set root directory: `Backend/server`
4. Build command: `npm install`
5. Start command: `npm start`
6. Add environment variables

#### DigitalOcean App Platform

heroku buildpacks:set heroku/nodejs

# Add MongoDB (Atlas recommended)
# Set environment variables
heroku config:set JWT_SECRET=your_secret
heroku config:set MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_uri

# Deploy
git push heroku main
```

### Database Deployment

#### MongoDB Atlas (Recommended)
1. Create account at [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
2. Create new cluster (Free tier available)
3. Create database user
4. Whitelist IP addresses (0.0.0.0/0 for all)
5. Get connection string
6. Update `MONGO_URI` in environment variables

**Connection String Format**:
```
mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/codeandchill?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

### Production Checklist

- [ ] Environment variables configured

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### MongoDB Connection Error
```
Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:27017
```
**Solution**: Ensure MongoDB is running
```bash
# Windows
net start MongoDB

# macOS/Linux
sudo systemctl start mongod
```

#### Port Already in Use
```
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3001
```
**Solution**: Kill process using the port
```bash
# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :3001
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# macOS/Linux
lsof -ti:3001 | xargs kill -9
```

#### CORS Error
```
Access to XMLHttpRequest blocked by CORS policy
```
**Solution**: Check backend CORS configuration in `server.ts`
```typescript
app.use(cors({
  origin: 'http://localhost:5173',
  credentials: true
}));
```

#### JWT Token Invalid
```
Error: jwt malformed
```
**Solution**: 
- Clear localStorage in browser
- Re-login to get new token
- Check JWT_SECRET is consistent

#### Judge0 API Error
```
Error: 429 Too Many Requests
```
**Solution**: 
- Check RapidAPI subscription limits
- Implement request throttling
- Consider upgrading plan

#### Gemini API Error
```
Error: API key not valid
```
**Solution**:
- Verify API key in `.env`
- Check API key permissions in Google AI Studio
- Ensure billing is enabled (if required)

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging:

**Backend**:
```typescript
// Add to server.ts
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  app.use(morgan('dev'));
}
```

**Frontend**:
```typescript
// Add to services/api.ts
axios.interceptors.request.use(request => {
  console.log('Starting Request', request);
  return request;
});
```
